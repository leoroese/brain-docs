Transforming reading annotations into evergreen notes is a useful way to retain and organize your knowledge and insights.

Before you begin, it's crucial to determine what is worth noting. To do this, you need to understand the structure of the information you've gathered.

### Pre Processing
1. Identify key concepts and central ideas
2. Cluster thoughts into related groups of ideas
3. Create and view organic structure

### Post Pre Processing 
1. Start with a broad note that captures the main idea of each cluster, forming the base for more refined notes.
2. Begin to refine into finer-grained notes, expand on the key points with detailed notes on each sub point
3. Connect and search for relevant past notes, integrate and connected to relevant previous thoughts
4. Revise and return to the broad note and improve the summary based on refined notes

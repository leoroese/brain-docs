title: First principles thinking
---
First principles thinking is an effective approach to problem-solving where you simplify complex problems or technologies to their most basic elements.

**Elon Musk's Simplified Process:**
1. **Identify and define current assumptions:**
	- Questions: Why do I think this? How do I know this is true?
	- Example: "I believe this algorithm is the most efficient."
2. **Break down the problem into fundamental principles:** 
	- Questions: What are the core components? Who, What, Where, When, Why, How?
	- Example: Analyze the algorithm's logic step by step. Is there a more fundamental way to approach the problem? Can existing solutions be decomposed to their basic principles and reassembled more efficiently?
3. **Create New Solutions from Scratch:**
	- Example: Redesign the algorithm using simpler, more efficient components identified through the process.

First principles thinking aligns closely with the concept of [[evergreen-notes]] and that [[evergreen-notes-should-be concept-oriented]]. In software development, as in note-taking, breaking down complex ideas into fundamental elements allows for the creation of clear, concise, and foundational solutions.

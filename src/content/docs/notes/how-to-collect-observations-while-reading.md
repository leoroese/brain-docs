One essential aspect of deep learning is to write in order to deepen understanding. However, collecting useful observations while reading can be challenging depending on the medium. Simultaneously, it's important to be [[the-power-of-being-fully-present-in-every-moment]].

This is where transient inboxes play a pivotal role. Below are a few methods applicable to different types of reading material
1. For physical texts, underline key points and mark observations with an asterisk * for future reference.
2. When reading web articles, you can copy and paste meaningful parts into transient notes including the URL for reference
3. For eBooks, export your highlights for further examination and refinement

Once you've collected your initial observations, the next step is to [[process-reading-annotations-into-evergreen-notes]] for longer-term utility and knowledge enhancement.

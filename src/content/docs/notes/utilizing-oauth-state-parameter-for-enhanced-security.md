title: Utilizing oauth state parameter for enhanced security
---
The primary use of the OAuth state parameter is to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. It achieves this by associating each request with a unique, non-guessable value, ensuring the authenticity of the request

In most cases, the state parameter should function as a nonce—an arbitrary value that is issued once to detect replay attacks.

## Client Side Storage

The state parameter can be stored client-side using cookies, local storage, or session storage. This stored value is essential for validating the authenticity of the response. If the states in the request and response don't match, the request could be malicious.


## How it works
1. **Generation**: The application generates a random string value.
2. **Storage**: This string is stored in local storage, session storage, or a cookie.
3. **Request Addition**: The state is added to the authorization request as an encoded URI component.
4. **Redirection**: The request, including the state, is sent via redirect.
5. **Verification**: Upon response, the app retrieves the stored state and verifies if it matches the response's state.
### Best Storage Practices:
- For Regular Web Apps: Use cookies or session storage.
- For Single-Page Applications (SPAs): Utilize local storage.
- For Native Applications: Store in memory or local storage.

Q: What is the primary use of the OAuth state parameter, and how is it implemented?
A: The OAuth state parameter is primarily used to mitigate CSRF attacks by associating each authorization request with a unique, non-guessable value. It is stored client-side—using cookies, local storage, or session storage—and verified upon response to ensure the request's authenticity.

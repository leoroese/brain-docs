Following that [[evergreen-notes-should-be concept-oriented]] as a basis for your writing can transform any writing task from 'creating' to 'editing'.

When you maintain evergreen notes, you can easily create an outline for any narrative or argument by simply selecting the relevant notes. This also allows you to identify gaps in your outline, and create new notes to fill these gaps.

For example, if you're writing about web-development trends, you could start by selecting evergreen notes on various web technologies, programming principles, and recent market vibes. As you organize and weave them into your outline, you may find gaps on emerging frameworks or technologies. Creating new [[evergreen-notes]] to fill these gaps not only helps complete your article but also grows your note collection for future use.

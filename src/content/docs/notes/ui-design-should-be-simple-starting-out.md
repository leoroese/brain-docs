title: UI design should be simple starting out
---
It's common to over-engineer a user interface (UI), but simplicity in early UI design speeds up app development and improves overall design. YAGNI (you aren't going to need it) and KISS (keep it simple stupid) are both useful programming mantra's that transfer over to UI design.

### 1. Work in Cycles
Build your application feature by feature, instead of focusing on layouts. 

While designing a feature follow these rules:
- Don't over invest, design on low fidelity like a piece of paper if necessary.
- Don't design functionality that you aren't immediately ready to build.
	- Some features a harder to build.
- Design, implement, design, implement.

### 2. Hold the design choices
Wait to implement design characteristics like color, typefaces, and mood.

#### Grayscale
Start with grayscale, this forces you to rely on spacing, hierarchy, and ordering to do the heavy lifting. You can easily add colors later on.

#### Personality
Implement personality through font choice, colors, borders, and wording.

### 3. Design system
Use a design system, limit yourself to the different options for colors, sizes, etc. Similar to tailwinds utility classes.

**Design feature** -> **Implement feature** -> **Design next feature** -> **Implement next feature**

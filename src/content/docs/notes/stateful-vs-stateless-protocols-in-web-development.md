---
In web development, choosing between stateful and stateless protocols is a fundamental decision that significantly impacts the architecture and performance of web applications.

## Stateless

Stateless protocols, like HTTP and DNS, treat each transaction as a new event, independent of past interactions. 

This approach simplifies architecture and enhances scalability. They're commonly used in web browsing and RESTful APIs.

## Stateful

Stateful protocols, while potentially faster due to their memory of past transactions, require more resources and create dependencies between the server and client, which can complicate scaling and resilience.

They find use in environments like online gaming and database connections, where a persistent state is beneficial.

Stateful protocols include:
- TCP
- WebSockets

Modern applications often combine stateful and stateless components by adding a stateful layer to a stateless protocol. This can be seen in cookie or token-based authentication, where each stateless request is associated with an entity without sacrificing the advantages of a stateless architecture.

Q: How do stateless and stateful protocols differ?
A: Stateless protocols treat each request as an independent event without retaining information from past interactions. Stateful protocols, however, maintain information from previous requests to inform future interactions.

Q: What protocol does the web widely use today?
A: The web predominantly uses stateless protocols like HTTP, often supplemented with stateful layers like JWT tokens or session cookies for managing state.

Accessibility is a critical aspect of any project. It aims to ensure that all potential users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can effectively use and interact with your product.

Incorporating accessibility from the project's inception and conducting regular testing will help detect any usability issues early. Besides aiding those with specific needs, accessibility practices enhance user experience universally and boost the overall quality of the project.

Additionally, adhering to accessibility standards can help meet legal requirements and avoid potential compliance issues.

During the development process, regularly ask yourself these accessibility-related questions to ensure inclusivity:
```ad-question
title: Accessibility questions
1. Is my component usable for screen readers?
2. Can visually impaired users understand the content? Is the central theme discernible even without color?
3. Are my buttons accessible to both keyboard-driven and touch-based interactions?
4. Does my project cater to users with hearing impairments? Is there any critical information exclusively conveyed through audio?
5. Are clickable areas sufficiently large to accommodate touch users, particularly those with motor control issues?
```

Remember that accessibility is about providing an equal experience for everyone.

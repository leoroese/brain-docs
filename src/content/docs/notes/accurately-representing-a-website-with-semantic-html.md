Semantic HTML plays a crucial role in web development by providing a more detailed way to organize web documents. 

It helps browsers, search engines, and developers accurately perceive the nature of the content being presented. 
````ad-tldr
semantic -- distinctly define their content
```html
<header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <h1>, <form>, <table>
```
non-semantic -- don't provide any specific information about their content
```html
<div>, <span>
```
````

Semantic html also helps improve accessibility by aiding screen readers with describing a web pages content.

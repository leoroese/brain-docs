title: Optimizing performance with batching
---
Batching is an effective technique to manage and optimize excessive updates.

It's like planning to have a conversation with your noise neighbor once, instead of yelling to shut up every time they make a noise.

In database management, batching is particularly useful. For instance, instead of executing multiple insert, update, or delete operations individually, these can be grouped into a single transaction.

Batching techniques are also beneficial in garbage collection, especially in reference counting systems. Here, the garbage collector accumulates variables that require cleanup and processes them in a batch. This method prevents the system from being interrupted each time a new resource needs removal, thereby optimizing overall performance.

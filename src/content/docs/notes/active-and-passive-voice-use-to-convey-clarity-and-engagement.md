title: Active and passive voice use to convey clarity and engagement
---
he choice between active and passive voice in writing not only affects clarity and engagement but also sets the tone and influences how readers perceive the content.

Active voice tends to create dynamic and direct sentences, making the writing more lively and easier to follow. It often results in shorter, more impactful sentences that are preferred in most writing styles.

For example, "John wrote the message"

Passive voice can be strategically used in scientific or formal writing where the focus needs to be on the object or the result of an action, rather than the subject performing it. It's useful for when you want to emphasize the action, rather than the subject performing it.

For example, "The essay was written by John"

In most cases, active voice is preferred because it tends to make sentences more energetic and direct. It implies action, which can make the material more engaging to the reader.

On the other hand, passive voice can be effective when the doer of the action is not known or not important, or when you want to focus on the action or the recipient of the action.

title: Allow structure to emerge organically
---
Allowing structure to emerge organically is like removing the lane guards in a bowling alley; it frees you to explore and adapt without the constraints of a predefined path.

> Sometimes it's uncertain where things belong

In many areas, especially in file systems and coding, a rigid, hierarchical structure can seem like the best approach. However, this often leads to challenges, especially when it's uncertain where specific items or pieces of information belong. We often end up pre-abstracting, which can hinder the evolution of the code.

Instead, adopting a flexible approach where the structure is allowed to develop organically can be more effective. This involves starting with a loose framework and allowing the details to fill in as the project evolves. For instance, this website, and my Obsidian vault, have all of their notes under a single root directory. This might change as structure organically evolves.

To implement this in practice, start with a general simple idea but remain open to adjustments. Start to notice patterns and pain points, and realize where some structure might be beneficial or an abstraction makes sense.

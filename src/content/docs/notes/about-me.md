title: About me
---
Hello! I'm Leo, a full-stack software engineer at [Arch](https://www.arch.dev/).

My journey into coding is a bit unconventional. I started as a walk-on basketball player at Gonzaga University. As I quickly realized I wasn't really that good, my passion for video games led me to computer science. Switching my major meant missing practices and team events, and eventually, I had to make the tough decision to move on from basketball, which had been my life for the first 21 years.

This turned out to be the best decision I've ever made. I've found a new love in coding, a passion for technology, and the freedom that software engineering brings to build things.

Born in the U.S with Brazilian roots, I've always embraced a mix of cultures and am extremely grateful for all that my family has provided me.

Currently, I'm traveling the world with my beautiful fianc√©e, who supports me unconditionally.

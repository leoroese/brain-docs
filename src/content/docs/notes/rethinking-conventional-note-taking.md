title: Rethinking conventional note taking
---

The conventional way most people take notes can be likened to filling a bucket. We often jot down information to 'not forget', and not as a precursor to deeper thought.

Traditional notes often end up as isolated islands of information â€“ separate and rarely revisited. This leads to a vast but disconnected collection of facts, offering little in terms of building a cohesive body of knowledge or understanding.

Reflecting on my university years, I remember taking thousands of 'sequential' notes. While this method appeared productive at the time, in retrospect, it often hindered my ability to retain and connect information, particularly when topics were revisited in a non-sequential manner. This personal journey highlights the inherent limitations of traditional note-taking: it often favors memorization at the expense of true understanding and fosters isolated learning instead of interconnected exploration.

Such an approach results in 'transient' notes

> Transient: Lasting a short time

The traditional approach starkly contrasts with the principle that [[knowledge-work-should-accumulate]]. Rather than settling for transient notes, we should aim to develop a system of [[evergreen-notes]], a dynamic and interconnected framework that fosters deeper understanding.

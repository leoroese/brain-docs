title: In depth understanding software development is crticial
---
One of the key issues with software development is superficial understanding of how something works.

While the 'ship faster' and 'fail quickly' paradigms drive rapid product development, a thorough comprehension of tools and technologies provide a more sustainable future in software development.

However, I believe this race against time often overlooks the immense value of comprehending the inner workings of our tools. Without this comprehension, we risk building our work on shaky foundations.

In my experience at Biodock, I often followed practices based on external advice or because they "just" worked. In hindsight, understanding the 'why' and 'how' behind my decisions would have led to more informed decisions and perhaps more effective problem-solving and communication.

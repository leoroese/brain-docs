title: Mastering the art of consistent action and reflection
---
By nature, human beings are hoarders, driven by instinct to collect and accumulate various items. Whether it's Pokemon cards, receipts, or material notes, we have some inate instinct to collect and preserve for the future.

However, this accumulation of materials can often lead to collections that just gathers dust. Our resources become a figurative (sometimes literal) mountain that we want to avoid.

Hence, embracing the principle of [[the-importance-of-having-a-constant-feedback-loop]] becomes essential. Regular action, consistent reflection, and pruning of what we collect can avert hoarding and transform our unsorted dump into a treasure trove.

To implement this, I use "transient-read" and "transient-write" folders in Obsidian. After a set amount of time, my daily note will surface these notes to me, forcing me to act on them.

title: tradeoffs-of-using-types-in-programming
---
Types enhance readability and maintainability of a code base. They make it easier for a team of developers to gain comprehension of intent through it's explicit nature.

The use of types help improve tooling. Better static analysis, refactoring capabilities, and code generation are all possible due to types.

However, these benefits come at a cost. Statically analyzing every piece of trash code I write isn't free, this can lead to slow downs in my coding environment. 

Depending on the language (cough cough typescript), it might also introduce an extra transpilation step, further slowing down my development process.

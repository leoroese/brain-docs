### 1. Dive into general documentation
This helps me familiarize myself with syntax and the quirks of the new language

### 2. Problem solving through advent of code
I then solve a couple of advent-of-code problems. This helps in applying the language to a wide array of problems, helping expose me to how to properly use the langauge.

### 3. Websocket / api server
Building a simple WebSocket or API allows me to get hands-on experience with request/response cycle. This project provides an excellent way to delve into the ecosystem.

### 4. Large scale project
If I like the language, then i'll use it in a large scale project. This helps me understand the pain points of the language more deeply.

### 5. Next steps
- Setup testing
- Read similar repos and best practices

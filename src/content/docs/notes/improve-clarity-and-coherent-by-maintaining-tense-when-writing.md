Maintaining a consistent tense while writing is crucial to ensure clarity and coherence. 
Switching between tenses without reason can confuse readers about the timeline of events and disrupt the narrative flow.

Consider these examples:
```ad-tip
Bad: "Yesterday, I **go** to the store. I **bought** some groceries and then **eat** and apple"

Good: "Yesterday, I **went** to the store. I **bought** some groceries and then **ate** an apple"
```

There are certain situations, like in narrative writing, where a deliberate change in tense might be appropriate.

title: Not all ui elements are created the same
---
As content creators say "Content is king", UI designers say "Hierarchy is king". Now, I've actually never heard anyone say that, but hierarchy is really important in UI design. So what does hierarchy mean here?

Hierarchy means:
- **Emphasis**: Deliberately emphasizing different elements and actions you want the user to see
- **Contrast**: Utilizing contrast whether through color, size, shadows to guide the user through your app.
- **Actions**: Not all actions on the page are equal, you should promote primary actions, clearly show secondary actions, and allow tertiary, non important actions to still be discoverable
- **Destruction**: You can add an extra step to ensure a destructive step is the primary action. Including dialogs, popups, or other confirmation steps.

## Tips
- Use font weight and color vs font size
- Stick to certain colors and font weights
	- Typically 2 font weights are all that are needed. Like base and semi-bold
	- Stay away from font weights under 400, use a lighter color instead of a lighter font weight
- Beware gray text on colored backgrounds, used shaded version of the same color instead
- Emphasize by deemphasizing
- Labels as a last resort (outside of forms for accessibility)
	- Combine labels with values "12 items in stock", "4 beds"
	- Emphasize labels in spec or when expected
- Use semantic html but with better styling. For example h1 tags for titles with font-size 16

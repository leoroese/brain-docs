title: Evergreen notes should be concept oriented
---
Concept-oriented notes are essential for creating effective [[evergreen-notes]], aligning perfectly with [[first-principles-thinking]]. This approach helps simplify complex information down to its essential principles, enhancing our understanding and retention.

By focusing on the 'concept', your notes become more durable. They can serve as building blocks for new thoughts, ideas, and insights over time, allowing notes to remain relevant and valuable regardless of time or context.

## Putting into practice

To create effective concept-oriented notes, start by questioning the 'why' and 'how' behind a fact or process. Seek out the underlying principles and establish patterns. This practice not only enhances your understanding but also weaves a network of knowledge where each note reinforces each other, embodying the principle that [[knowledge-work-should-accumulate]]

Consider learning Python as an example. Rather than listing syntax rules, focus on Pythonâ€™s core philosophy of simplicity and readability. Create a note titled "Python's philosophy of simplicity and readability", exploring how python prioritizes clear and readable syntax. As you encounter python's libraries, revisit and expand this note. For example, add insights on Django's design principle of 'explicit over implicit', illustrating how it reflects python's overarching philosophy.

This transforms your notes from mere static text, into dynamic resources that grow with your experience.

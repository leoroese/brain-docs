Interpreted languages are languages that do not have an ahead of time compilation step.

These languages aim to be highly dynamic with the tradeoff of speed.

This tradeoff is less apparent due to [[jit-the-bridge-between-interpreted-and-compiled]], where interpreted languages add a compilation step during execution to optimize certain hotspots in the code.

Most interpreted languages follow a similar execution strategy: [[interpreted-languages-execution-strategy]] to one another.

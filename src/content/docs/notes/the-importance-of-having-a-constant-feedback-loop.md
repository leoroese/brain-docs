title: The importance of having a constant feedback loop
---
Feedback loops are essential tools in systems thinking, management, and learning. They offer ongoing insights into our performance, helping us refine our capabilities across many fields.

**In knowledge work**: For instance, tools like [[evergreen-notes]] and Anki create feedback loops that improve memory recall and insight.

**In sports**: Athletes often study film to analyze their performance. This visual feedback allows them to identify areas of improvement.

**In writing and resource gathering**: Feedback loops in these areas help bring transient information to the surface. The process allows us to evaluate information, acting on what's valuable and removing what's not.

## My own daily feedback loops
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/): By testing myself on flashcards at increasing intervals, I gain continuous feedback on my grasp of a subject.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): As part of my daily note, I have a data view that brings my transient-read and transient-writes to my attention based off a "judgement day" property. I then either act on it, postpone it, or delete it.

title: Utilizing docker volumes for container data persistence and sharing
---
Volumes in Docker are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by containers. 

**Uses for Volumes**:
1. **Local Development Changes**: Volumes facilitate local development by tracking changes to files in real-time, akin to tools like Nodemon.
2. **Data Persistence**: They provide a way to persist data across container lifecycles, ensuring that important data isn't lost when containers are stopped or restarted.
3. **Sharing Between Containers**: Volumes can be shared among multiple containers, allowing for efficient data access and management.

### Best Practices
- **Named Mounts**: Named mounts are easier to locate, backup, and manage than anonymous volumes.

title: Revolutionizing content delivery on the edge
---
Special content delivery network (CDN) that ships with a runtime, allowing you to do some 'server side' work as close as possible to the client.

This reduces latency, increases speed, and improves the user experience by performing the server side computation as close as possible to the client.

Edge networks can both store and process data, where traditional CDNs typically only store cached data.

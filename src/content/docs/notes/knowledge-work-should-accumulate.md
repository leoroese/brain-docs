title: Knowledge work should accumulate
---

Knowledge work, by common practice, is largely ephemeral - we expend effort to solve a problem, and once we achieve the outcome, the process and knowledge gained are often discarded.

> Ephemeral: Lasting a very short time

In my experience as a software engineer, I frequently encounter this ephemeral nature of knowledge work. While working on complex problems using various technologies, I've noticed that the skills and understanding I develop often begin to fade once the immediate project is completed and the solution is implemented.

A useful comparison is that knowledge is like a muscle, it atrophies without regular practice and revisitation.

There are valuable tools and strategies we can employ to transform this nature of knowledge work from ephemeral to cumulative:

- [[spaced-repetition-an-effective-learning-system]]: This system aids in remembering and retaining information over time through strategically scheduled review sessions.
- [[evergreen-notes]]: These are purposefully crafted notes that can be easily reviewed, refined, and built upon, ensuring long-term relevance and applicability.

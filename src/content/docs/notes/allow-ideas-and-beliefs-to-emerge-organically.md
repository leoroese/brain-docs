It's important to be aware of preconceived notions and their potential to cloud our thinking and decision-making processes. These pre-set ideas can limit our vision, stifling creativity and the inhibiting the emergence of fresh, unconventional ideas.

By embracing independent thinking, we can overcome such limitations. Independent thinking allows us to explore diverse perspectives, questions assumptions, and fosters the organic growth of new ideas and beliefs.
